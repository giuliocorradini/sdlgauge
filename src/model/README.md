# model

This library implements different ways of extracting or generating data to feed the gauge.

The engine revs can be generated from a linear power band (basic usage of this module), that
simply goes up and down, or in response to an input sound (the sound of the engine), or custom
power bands might be defined to simulate more complex engines.
